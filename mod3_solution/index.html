        jn lijh ijl jil sildfuhjsvlskgjergnv regvse are using Bootstrap for this assignment, instead of specifying pixel
        ranges, I will define our desktop, tablet, and mobile views in terms of Bootstrap CSS class prefixes, i.e., md,
        sm, and xs.

        Desktop mockup illustration should correspond to Bootstrap md-based classes
        Tablet mockup illustration should correspond to Bootstrap sm-based classes
        Mobile mockup illustration should correspond to Bootstrap xs-based classes
        Navbar: Create a navbar that scrolls away together with the page (the navbar should become invisible and is not
        fixed to the top when you scroll the page down). The navbar should have a company name (i.e., navbar-brand
        class) called "Food, LLC" that is aligned to the left side of the navbar. (See
        https://getbootstrap.com/docs/3.3/components/#navbar. Make the browser window narrower to see the mobile menu
        button appear in the first example shown at the provided link.)

        For desktop and tablet view, the navbar should not contain anything else. No other buttons should be visible.
        (Hint: use 'visible-xs' class.)

        For desktop and tablet view, the navbar should not contain anything else. No other buttons should be visible.
        (Hint: use 'visible-xs' class.)

        Navbar - Mobile View: Create a simple menu button (3 horizontal bars). When the user clicks that button, a
        dropdown menu should appear (as illustrated in Mobile Open Menu illustration below.) The dropdown menu should
        contain 3 items: Chicken, Beef, and Sushi.

        The dropdown menu should take up the entire width of the browser window. Make sure the dropdown menu has a
        background color set that distinguishes it from the rest of the content.

        (Hint: See https://getbootstrap.com/docs/3.3/components/#navbar and Lecture 31 for examples on how to accomplish
        this.)

        Page Heading. The page heading that says Our Menu should be centered within the browser window. You must use a
        Bootstrap class to accomplish this.

        (Hint: look for a Bootstrap class that centers text, see https://getbootstrap.com/docs/3.3/css/#type-alignment.)

        Create a single really tall section that will use the Bootstrap Grid and take up the entire width of the browser
        window (minus some margins, of course) for all views: desktop, tablet, and mobile. To make the section really
        tall, you can either fill it out with a LOT of text or simply set its height to something like 1000px. It needs
        to be tall enough to cause scrolling down to be required to view the bottom of the section. Make sure its
        background color is set to distinguish it from the rest of the content. (Hint: don't forget to have an element
        with a class='container' or class='container-fluid' wrapping your grid. Remember that to have the grid do
        something "always", i.e., no matter what browser window size, use the col-xs-... classes. In this case, since we
        want the section to take up the entire row, use col-xs-12.)button (3 horizontal bars). When the user clicks that
